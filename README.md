A Colab (online python 3 notebook version) could be found out here. 
## Learning Functions in Large Networks requires Modularity and produces Multi-Agent Dynamics

## Adjacency-Matrix-Visualizer

### A scalable tool to visualize the adjacency matrix with values on the edges, direction, and the sum of value as the node size.

- to use the Adjacency-Matrix-Visualizer. Please refer to ![Visualizer.m](https://github.com/huckiyang/EvoluGeneNet-Adjacency-Matrix-Visualizer/blob/master/Adj_Network_Visualization/Visualizer.m). 

- Put your matrix in Visualizer(martix) could get the scalable visualizatoin. 

## Functional Dynamic Gene Circuit
